O lead me onward to the loneliest shade,
Feebly she laugheth in the languid moon,
If solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief,
He hated nought but--to be sad,
An' Charlie Fox threw by the box,
And miller-thumbs and gudgeons driving out,
"With o'erweening complacence our state to compare,
Had he, though blindly contumelious, brought
And 'twere more fit that she should sit,
Where use had made it sweet, with eyelids closed,
But trust not this; too easy Youth, beware!
The short'ning winter-day is near a close;
Where distant ships do seem to show their keels,
Making the Sun like blood, the Earth a tomb,
Hath snatched the little joy that Life had yet to lend.
And when they're come, the very pleasant rout:
And industry her care awhile foregoes;
And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep
Another city doth he set about,
It may send Balmaghie to the Commons,
To witness what I after shall narrate;
Grim vengeance yet shall whet a sword
The regiment at large for a husband I got;
But Davie, lad, I'm red ye're glaikit;
When rural life, o' ev'ry station,
What race of Chiefs and Heroes did she bear?
Until, impatient in embarrassment,
There were three kings into the east,
Towards her with the Muses in thine heart;
Not even I, for one whole month, will pry
Than hers, the fair sae far awa.
View unsuspecting Innocence a prey,
Perchance my Dog will whine in vain,
Bring love and music to the mind.
Oh! where, Dodona!  is thine agéd Grove,
Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all,
And long he travers'd to and fro, to acquaint
And short-sleeved gown, that half to guess reveals
Amang the braes o' Ballochmyle!
If the ass was the king of the brutes.
If, hapless chance! they linger lang,
Of not a hoarded farthing be possesst,
Shew'd me that epic was of all the king,
While strangers, only, not regardless pass,
Smith opens out his cauld harangues,
Of a swan's neck unseen among the rushes:
But here the Babylonian Whore hath built
How could they find out in Lorenzo's eye
To thee! But then I thought on poets gone,
Even as a broken Mirror,  which the glass
But sighed oer pleasures ere she left her home;
Whose shock was as an Earthquake's,  and opprest
Waits at the doors of heaven. Thou art not
Velino cleaves the wave-worn precipice;
Weel, since he has left me, may pleasure gae wi' him,
As thou at all mankind the flag unfurls,
Wha will kiss me where I lie?--
Thy haunts are ever where the dead walls rear
Such innocence to ruin,--who vilely cheats
And battles tell from foreign land.
And spent the cheerful, festive night;
Through the thick branches, poor ring-doves sleek forth
A venerable priest full soberly,
It ne'er was wealth, it ne'er was wealth,
That which disfigures it; and they who war
Or, rustlin, thro' the boortries comin,
Without one hope, without one faintest trace
Floats o'er this vast and wondrous monument,
And my daddie has nought but a cot-house and yard;
With mellow utterance, like a cavern spring,
Though thou forsakest a deceived thing;--
A little brook. The youth had long been viewing
There is a dungeon, in whose dim drear light
Curs'd be the man, the poorest wretch in life,
Muffling his face, of greeting friends in fear,
Thou seest a wretch who inly pines,
Worship like conquered foes to the Apennine,
Of nature, nor of nature's sweets aware;
And sorrel untorn by the dew-claw'd stag:
Thae bonnie bairntime, Heav'n has lent,
Around the silken couches, wondering
Gowff'd Willie like a ba', man,
Fright and perplex, so also shuddered he--
In ploughman phrase, 'God send you speed,'
I hae been in for't once or twice,
I saw this youth as he despairing stood:
And when, at length, the mind shall be all free
Just like that bird am I in loss of time,
Free as the air, invisibly, she strays
Of high and noble life with thoughts so sick?
As Heaven and Earth are fairer, fairer far
He wander'd through, oft wondering at such swell
Shall strongly heave my breast,
These thoughts now come o'er me with all their might:--
And o'er the bed she brought her;
The poetry of speech? No;--even his tomb
Why should man's high aspiring mind
And I will wear them for his sake,
And then your every care and fear
Endymion! one day thou wilt be blest:
Yet come, thou child of poverty and care,
To make us feel existence, and to shew
Thro' the hazels spreading wide,
Wouldst heed the truths I sing,
My son! my son! may kinder stars
Wha has mair honour in his breast
Could he some commutation broach,
O Jeanie fair, I lo'e thee dear;
Mice are not reckoned greater thieves.
Yet stops me o' my lawfu' prey,
Wha's ain dear lass that he likes best,
Is shameful to the nations,--most of all,
The crowd's loud shout and ladies' lovely glance,
I bow'd a tranced vassal: nor would thence
And fields which promise corn and wine,
Man with all his pow'rs you scorn;
Ye Mountains, that see us descend to the shore,
The Glory which at once upon thee did not dart,
Was strongly marked in her face;
One stands on tiptoe for a linnet's nest
And turned to smile upon thy bashful eyes,
O poortith cauld, and restless love,
I opened the casement this morn at starlight,
Placed for her lordly use thus far, thus vile, below.
In their shut breasts their petty misery.
No man with the half of 'em e'er went far wrong;
I kenn'd it still your wee bit jauntie
So I can rhyme nor write nae mair;
The sun he went down--the last gleam from his brow
My wooer he caper'd as he'd been in drink,
The quavering thunder thereupon had ceas'd,
I would not feign a single sigh
In the very deeps of pleasure, my sole life?"--
Her pliant bending hazel's arching sticks:
Inspires my muse to gie 'm his dues,
"O how deil, Tam, can that be true?
And where we think the truth least understood,
Darken'd the place; and neighing steeds were heard,
(Not moony madness more astray;)
Till skelp--a shot--they're aff, a' throther
And when you read the simple artless rhymes,
Light-footed damsels move with gentle paces
Than an old hedge to Goody Blake?
Pale he surrenders at the tyrant's throne!
She thro' the whins, an' by the cairn,
Marked her black eye that mocks her coal-black veil,
For Murray's  light horse are to muster,
And after, straight in that inspired place
The noble Maxwells and their powers
They've lost some gallant gentlemen,
How the lit lake shines, a phosphoric sea,
Your pardon, Sir, for this digression.
A Prologue, Epilogue, or some such matter,
His soft and summer breath, whose tender power
The echoing wood, the winding flood,
And tyranny of love be somewhat scar'd!
And in the morning twilight wandered forth
But tent me, Davie, ace o' hearts!
Will Gaul or Muscovite redress ye? No!
The ministers of grief and pain,
To bind them all about with tiny rings.
In careless mood he looked at me,
But O, to see auld Nick gaun hame,
I'll weep and sigh wheneer she wills
Childe Harold saw, like meteors in the sky,
The quiet glooms of such a piteous theme.
'Till we were wae and weary, O;
Thy former realm, I call thee from the dust!
For Buskie-glen and a' his gear.
Were they but so in Man's, how different were his doom!
I saw parch'd Abyssinia rouse and sing
Yirr, fancy barks, awa' we canter
For better lore would seldom yearn,
Save in those arms of thine, love.
In the bands of old friendship and kindred so set,
Was Death or Life--the playthings of a crowd--
Or darkling grubs this earthly hole,
But an auld man shall never daunton me.
While slee Dundas arous'd the class,
That our heart-broken parting is so nigh.
Whence I may copy many a lovely saying
He who ascends to mountain-tops, shall find
Wit, and grace, and love, and beauty
Thro' weary winter's wind and rain,
Where had he been, from whose warm head out-flew
Bright, and cirque-couchant in a dusky brake.
My foolish tongue, and listening, half afraid,
Young Peggy's face was common sense and I was rather shy
Lest bogles catch him unawares;
The mair they talk I'm kent the better,
Sometimes I lost them, and then found again;
From the deep throat of sad Melpomene!
Whoever looks round sees Eternity there.
None's born for such troubles as I be:
Nae thought, nae view, nae scheme o' livin',
Struggling, and blood, and shrieks--all dimly fades
"And joined the wandering gypsey-folk.
Of his impeded Soul would through his bosom eat.
Hast sifted well the atom-universe;
Bark ribbed like corderoy in seamy screed,
Daisies and cowslips dropping round,
Each tells the unco's that he sees or hears;
To strike evil doers wi' terror;
While flew the vessel on her snowy wing,
A fortnight and nine days we in the harbour lay,
May still your life from day to day
And here, by sweet, endearing stealth,
Give consolation in this woe extreme.
As a large cross, some old cathedral's crest,
Would rot in its oblivion--in the sink
Sunshine and shadows, tempests loud, and calms;
Ye're welcome for the sake o't.
How delicious was the dinner time on such a showery day!
A mortal quite unfit for fortune's strife,
And Johnny is not yet in sight,
An hey, sweet ane-and-twenty, Tam!
The very wrinkles gothic in his face:
The Marinere, whose eye is bright,
Would gladly woo thine Echoes with his string,
Wha sweetly tune the Scottish lyre,
The parting signal streamed, at last the land withdrew,
Yet, turning quick with shudder chill,
Of porphyry, jasper, agate, and all hues
A three days' journey in a moment done:
Or were more in fury seen, Sir,
With envy, what the old man hardly feels.
From such a stedfast spell his lady's eyes;
With honest pride, I scorn each selfish end:
Then may heaven with prosp'rous gales,
Bloody dissectors, worse than ten Monroes!
Come hither, lad, an' answer for't,
For her I'll dare the billows' roar,
The roaring Fyers pours his mossy floods;
She's at the hedge of Harry Gill.
Ye worthy Proveses, an' mony a Bailie,
Lolls him o'er the pasture gate.
In sacred custom, that he well nigh fear'd
Seven days, seven nights I saw that curse
From weary tendrils, and bow'd branches green,
His locks were bleached white with time,
So fairy-quick, was strange! Bewildered,
And Summer, with his fervid-beaming eye:
Whase wife's twa nieves were scarce weel bred,
And hark the little Vesper-bell
And blythe she trips the dewy grass
My thirst for the world's praises: nothing base,
A' ye douce folk I've borne aboon the broo,
Whose sun-burnt skin, and cheeks chuffed out with fat,
_This_ breathed itself to life in Julie, _this_
If thou at friendship's sacred ca'
Gie me ae spark o' Nature's fire!
That's little short o' downright wastrie.
Gives it a touch ethereal--a new birth:
Wha got my young Highland thief.
Clear'd them of heavy vapours, burst them wide
With friendship's welcome "how do ye do?"
The fiery Greek, his red pursuing spear;
But Oh! poor wretch!--he read, and read, and read,
As one who by some savage stream,
Their groves o' sweet myrtle let foreign lands reckon,
It were mair meet that those fine feet
Quickly break her prison-string
He turns his back to catch his breath awhile,
Compose a mind like thine? though all in one
Wi' gentles thou erects thy head;
Haply it was the workings of its pride,
And as we're merry, may we still be wise.
Ye gipsey-gang that deal in glamour,
Couldst thou forebode the dismal hour which now
Smoothed for intoxication by the breath
They break out on him, like a loathsome plague-spot;
The chanting linnet, or the mellow thrush,
Maks hours like minutes, hand in hand,
Had I been used to pass my weary eves;
The night hath ta'en the place of day,
There, oft as mild evening weeps over the lea,
Till the next morning rang her passing-bell.
In the old border full of maple trees
While Afric's echoes thrilled with Moorish matrons' wail.
And make my bed in the Collier's neuk,
All fancy, pride, and fickle maidenhood,
To gipsies' camps to have our fortunes told;
And start with awe at mine own strange pretence.
The sun above the mountain's head,
Descry a favourite hamlet faint and far.
They through each key-hole pop and pop,
To stretch me often on thy shadowed sward,
So may our Country's name be undisgraced,
Or league to teach all Kings true Sovereignty?
As whiles they're like to be my dead
The Gods become as mortals--and man's fate
Peril he sought not, but ne'er shrank to meet:
Nae mair the knaves shall wrang her,
And from the pillowy silkiness that rests
Thou wast the mountain-top--the sage's pen--
The wheels o' life gae down-hill, scrievin,'
Alas! I can make you no sweeter return!
Into the noisy world almost forsworn.
To me his arms were spread, to me his voice
When Elements to Elements conform,
Ilk cowslip cup shall kep a tear:
At these enchantments, and yet many more,
And their long holiday that feared not grief,
To meditate 'gainst friend the secret blow,
When past the shower, and ev'ry flower
Earth'd up here lies an imp o' hell,
Sparkled his jetty eyes; his feet did show
_He!_ with a glory round his furrowed brow,
And, though he has but one eye left,
And suffering I am doom'd to bear;
For each their old love found. A murmuring rose,
While care-untroubled mortals sleep!
"Still as a Slave before his Lord,
They dally with the winds and laugh at hell.
For many a joy could he from Night's soft presence glean.
Which by just right should come of mighty Gods;
'Till on that har'st I said before,
These wonders strange be sees, and many more,
Opinion an Omnipotence,--whose veil
The Tories, Whigs, give way by turns;
No nerves olfact'ry, Mammon's trusty cur,
In a grassy nook hard by, with a little patch of sky,
To crop a cowslip in their company.
And mountains; and of all that we behold
But to my heart I'll add my hand,
Implore His counsel and assisting might:
Was as a fairy city of the heart,
The English steel we could disdain;
Thou may'st find those will love thee dear--
While yet, to fancy's sleepless eye,
Whyles daez't wi' love, whyles daez't wi' drink,
Is in his "narrow house" for ever darkly low.
To wanton in carnage, and wallow in gore;
Yes, this was once Ambition's airy hall,
That turns to red a staghorn-shaped seed,
Mackenzie, Stewart, sic a brace
Around thee, when thy lyre was strung.
I waked, and saw my little boy,
False friends, false love, farewell! for mair
Of happiness, and thoughts arise
As though they jests had been: nor had he done
What rainbow tints, what magic charms are found!
Till he forgets his loves or debts,
The witching curs'd delicious blinkers
'Tis all the same with Harry Gill;
Leaving nothing but a little naked spring.
Nor round thy shining slippers crawl.
The maids, impatient now old Goody ceased,
And in the village street where meanest weeds
Because they could not conquer. There sits Day
Unto our souls, and bound to us so fast,
Leaning with parted lips, some words she spake
The flight of one they cannot match,
Maidens, like moths, are ever caught by glare,
Like spiked aloe. If an innocent bird
Thus goes he on from day to day,
But pith and power, till my last hour,
And ev'ry time had added proofs
Or view the Lord of the unerring bow,
'My father blessed me fervently,
He heard but the last words, nor could contend
Or deep-ton'd plovers, gray, wild-whistling o'er the hill;
I thank Thee, Author of this opening day!
Yet was I born where men are proud to be,--
Eyed like a peacock, and all crimson barr'd;
Where every zephyr-sigh pouts, and endows
With speed of fire-tailed exhalations;
Or crispy hills, and hollows scant of sward,
Her yellow hair, beyond compare,
To their most great and growing region, where
Oh! dreadful price of being to resign
And freedom's bawl was sanction to the song.
In one swift moment, would what then he saw
Because God meant mankind should set
And how they kist each other's tremulous eyes:
With dancing and loud revelry,--and went
Maytime is to the meadows coming in,
Of her lorn voice, she oftentimes would cry
He lurks, nor casts his heavy eye afar,
I have heard the cloudy thunder: Where is power?
They raise a din, that, in the end,
Could bend that bow heroic to all times.
Nor from the seat of scornful pride
Love from amongst her griefs?--for such the affections are.
And yet how lovely in thine age of woe,
When the best wark-lume i' the house
The cripple threw his crutch away.
Did they not tend your rising grain,
How could these money-bags see east and west?--
At Darlet we a blink did tarry;
While claver blooms white o'er the lea,
The other, deep and slow, exhausting thought,
And warsle time, on' lay him on his back!
I'll drap the lyre, and mute admire
Mutters an angry look at all he meets.
We left fair Scotland's strand;
My husband's father told it me,
And then I fell asleep. Ah, can I tell
There was Maggy by the banks o' Nith,
I will advance a terrible right arm
May prudence, fortitude, and truth
It mingled strangely with my fears,
Others along the safer turnpike fly;
While pointers round impatient burn'd,
Blasted below the dun hot breath of War.
She gently pats the pony's side,
He's gane! he's gane! he's frae us torn,
Craigdarroch, so famous for wit, worth, and law;
Even through the closest searment  half betrayed?
The wild Albanian kirtled to his knee,
Fall in bold manhood's hardy prime!
On th' bonny banks of Ayr to meet,
Who hath not loiter'd in a green church-yard,
The brave poor sodger ne'er despise,
Sweet lady, let her pray, and sleep, and dream
But, hark ye, friend! I charge you strictly
For pillow may have slept an hour away;
So calls the woodlark in the grove,
As if to sweep down all things in its track,
At stacks o' pease, or stocks o' kail.
Gie me the hour o' gloamin gray,
Of beast, behemoth, and leviathan,
Go frighten the coward and slave;
And just to stop, and just to move,
Was in his plaited brow: yet, his eyelids
To meet old Dobson's timely frown,
Abode of Gods, whose shrines no longer burn.
Weel clad wi' coat o' glossy black;
Thy minions, kings, defend, control, devour,
Of arméd horse, and many a warlike store,
For ale and brandy's stars and moon,
Foot-feather'd Mercury appear'd sublime
Wi' sword an' gun he thought a sin
She gaz'd--she redden'd like a rose--
Gaur Satan gie her a--e a clink
Clamping defiance oer the stoney ground,
The wild green landscape. Once again I see
And by my power is her beauty veil'd
Bound to the Earth, he lifts his eye to Heaven--
And of thy spicy myrtles as they blow,
Has made them baith no worth a f----t,
By myriads, when they dare to pave their way
When Thebes Epaminondas rears again,
The glittering minarets of Tepalen,
Of those who in the cause of freedom fell:
Tho' I were doom'd to wander on
The crimson-scarféd men of Macedon;
These delicates he heap'd with glowing hand
Thy forehead, and to Jupiter cloud-borne
While laigh descends the simmer sun,
Thy lips, and antheming a lonely grief.
And sacred Nature triumphs more in this
I can win my five pennies a day,
And near, Albano's scarce divided waves
For I have from my father gone,
His guardian seraph eyes with awe
I went with more, and kissed her for the last,
Farewell to the old mill and dash of the waters,
Through its tall woods with high romances blent:
Their lips touch'd not, but had not bade adieu,
An' straik her cannie wi' the hair,
He moves, and, by jingo, success to the plough!
And ne'er guid wine did fear, man,
Learn to despise those frowns now so terrific,
Shadow'd Enceladus; once tame and mild
Already with thee! tender is the night,
I cannot see what flowers are at my feet,
Pour'd into shapes of curtain'd canopies,
And to the silence made a gentle moan,
Upon the whirl, where sank the Ship,
And underneath the hay-stack warm,
Of his own sorrows) he and such as he
An' I blear my een wi' greetin'!
And still these two were postured motionless,
That Jane was sleeping in her watery grave.
The moonlight bay was white all o'er,
Aught else, aught nearer heaven, than such tears?
I'll ne'er forget till the day I die,
Have mov'd, even though Amphion's harp had woo'd
When Vulcan gies his bellows breath,
Through the cool depth.--It moved as if to flee--
Himself, a wife, he thus sustains,
He falls as dead and kicked by boys and men,
Into forgetfulness; when, stupefied,
Drops the light drip of the suspended oar,
May ye ne'er want a stoup o' bran'y
With bloody armaments and revolutions,
A dome, where flaunts she in such glorious sheen,
Along the grass as rude marauders hie,
One morning thus, by Esthwaite lake,
Over the fiery frontier of my realms
At length, says I, "Friend, where ye gaun,
Into a sort of oneness, and our state
A chiel's amang you taking notes,
For her forbears were brought in ships
With duller steel than the Perséan sword
And many dreadful fears beset her,
Or the low rumblings earth's regions under;
Restraint! imprisoned liberty! great key
Thou kens how he bred sic a splore,
Where plains will rise like ocean's waves,
Windingly by it, so the quiet maid
From every wasting sigh, from every pain,
While in a corner, ill at ease,
I glowr'd as I'd seen a warlock.
And barked of freedom--O I hate the sound
At the sweet sleeper,--all his soul was shook,--
Ne'er claw your lug, an' fidge your back,
And little fit to please a classic ear;
Nane sets the lawn-sleeve sweeter,
Even these words went echoing dismally
And so I did. When many lines I'd written,
There hollow sounds arous'd me, and I sigh'd
So thou, sweet rose-bud, young and gay,
Nor ever pleasure glad thy cruel heart.
Perhaps grown wearied of their Corinth talk:
Sappho's meek head was there half smiling down
Of earth-o'ergazing mountains,  --and thus take
And if 'twas born alive or dead,
But golden sands did never grace
The blithest bird upon the bush
Proud man, still seems the enemy of all.
In thy deceitful stream, a panting glow
Like things of yesterday my youthful pleasures.
"Over wide streams and mountains great we went,
Expel the venom and not blunt the dart--
An' threaten'd labour back to keep,
On times, and deeds, and darings that have been--
Thy wrongs should ring--and shall--from side to side;
The whole enormous matter into life.
Yet rich in kindest, truest love,
Her rich attire creeps rustling to her knees:
I taught thee how to pour in song,
To right or left, eternal swervin',
In the calm sunshine slept the glittering main.
On me, and on this damsel fair of mine,
Endymion feels it, and no more controls
(Lycius was gone to summon all his kin)
And now the sharp keel of his little boat
When some good spirit walks upon the earth,
His drooping head, and clear his soul of doubt,
Stoopt down and whipt a bit beneath his nose.
Are mysteries still neath Fate's unbroken seal.
And let a lush laburnum oversweep them,
I've seen the day ye butter'd my brose,
Men were thought wise who could not understand
Was sharpening for their pitiable bones.
Na, even tho' limpin' wi' the spavie
That foiled the knights in Marialva's dome:
They melt into thy yeast of waves, which mar
That spreading in this dull and clodded earth
Soft voices had they, that with tender plea
And I was gazing on the surges prone,
Its greasy skirtings twisted round his waist;
And chase for cowslips merry as before,
'Tis you and Taylor  are the chief,
Shall find some tidings in a future page,
Mount his back! thy sword unsheath!
To gaze on Amphitrite, queen of pearls,
An' I hae seen their coggie fou,
The castled Crag of Drachenfels
Will not our own and fellow-nations sneer,
That gentle Maid! and oft, a moment's space,
And thinks the mallard a sad worthless dog.
When it flutters in sun-beams that shine through a fountain?
He was the king o' a' the core,
To mark where England's province stands--
Endymion look'd at her, and press'd her hand,
Ah! shall I ever tell its cruelty,
As on with plashy step, and clouted shoon,
Slowly they sail, slowly as icy isle
Such as arises when a nation bleeds
With thy unquenchéd beam, lost Liberty!
Young Jockey was the blythest lad
Pensive awhile she dreams awake, and sees,
Fair Empress of the Poet's soul,
Of a sublimer aspect? Majesty--
A whole long month of May in this sad plight
His glimmering eyes that peep and doze;
But for her comforting! unhappy sight,
Tho' constantly on poortith's brink:
The curlers quat their roaring play,
_My_ blood from out thy being were an aim,
So do they run abouten all the day
To spur three leagues towards the Apennine;
The edict of Earth's rulers, who are grown
This garment hath been an old tenant with me;
For you, young potentate o' Wales,
My strong identity, my real self,
And bade to Christian tongues a long adieu;
As glad to waft him from his native home;
So far, that the uprooting Wind which tears
Ye'll some day squeal in quaking terror!
Who cannot feel for cold her tender feet,
With deaf endurance sluggishly they bear,
"Their graves are green, they may be seen,"
That drifts unfeather'd when bleak northerns blow;
Then to the vulture let each corse remain,
I've taught me other tongues--and in strange eyes
And oft grow fearful on their lonely way,
While at our feet, the voice of crystal bubbles
But there were some who feelingly could scan
Think! ye may buy the joys o'er dear--
Where guilt and poor misfortune pine!
Of old romance. These let us wish away,
She hurries eager if the eggs are dear,
For endless pleasure, by some coward blushes:
In sheltered spots.--Primroses when they get
Soon, too soon, your fears I trace.
I gat my death frae twa sweet een,
And, like the Ariosto of the North,
"Sax thousand years are near hand fled
Scarce hear amid the strife the poacher's muttering gun.
Some narrow, dirty, dungeon cave,
And with proud breast his own white shadow crowning;
The hearty grasp that sends a pleasant sonnet
If life eternal may await the lyre,
Such fancies fill the restless mind,
And what there was, I even forced it out.
What signifies the life o' man,
Now, by the pow'rs o' verse and prose!
A spacious landscape and a blooming field.
Tender soever, but is Jove's own care.
At these voluptuous accents, he arose,
I have beheld the Ephesian's miracle--
How mony lengthen'd sage advices,
When these words reach'd him. Whereupon he bows
Yet oft-times in his maddest mirthful mood
And from all serious Gods; that our delight
The vices also, must they club their curse?
O'er him who formed the Tuscan's siren tongue?
For she's to read a tale of hopes, and fears;
Their praise is hymned by loftier harps than mine;
Lovely as yonder sweet opening flower is,
And holds her by the gown to make her stay,
Seized their joint prey, the mother and the child!
May I be slander's common speech;
Our billie's gien us a' a jink,
The which to gain and keep, he sacrificed all rest.
Wha can do nought but fyke and fumble,
Repeated, successive, for many long years,
And, like the rootless stubble, tost
"Awake thy last sad voice, my harp!
And pastoral maidens milking cows
She laid, and to the level of his ear
Through dangerous winds, had but my footsteps worn
My soul to nothingness: but I will strive
And from black clouds the lightning flashes break.
Dissembled smiles, and jealous fears,
Unworthy things she talked and wild,
For brave Caledonia immortal must be;
Oft spying nests where he spring eggs had ta'en,
Land of Albania! where Iskander rose,
Unlawful, ever. O, be wiser thou!
Culling enchanted flowers; and he flew
The muse's gallop hurries me in sport
Thou ance was i' the foremost rank,
For the true reason no one knows,
And still the grass eternal springs
But when her nest is found she stops her song
That is to crown our name when life is ended.
Do think within their hearts they'll get them all
His voice leapt out, despite of godlike curb,
Your courage much more than your prudence you show it;
Of Lord of thee, and Arbiter of War--
And famous through all ages! but beneath
So plainly character'd, no breeze would shiver
Till at its shoulders it should proudly see
As whilome he was wont the leagues to cheer,
At things which, but for thee, O Latmian!
Or blinding drifts wild-furious flee,
There to remain for ever, as I fear:
Beside the osiers of a rivulet,
Shalt one day, if found worthy, so defined
Then doubt the sun gives light,
And thus, untaught in youth my heart to tame,
Gurgling where the fisher floats,
From kissing cymbals made a merry din--
While boyish blood is mantling, who can 'scape
And the false semblance but disgraced his brow;
"My patriot son fills an untimely grave!"
In the mid days of autumn, on their eves
Hung swollen at their backs, and jewel'd sands
In comes a gaucie, gash guidwife,
Will slime the rose to night. Though if thou wilt,
Shall kindle up its living fire
Remember'd from its velvet summer song.
How did I love to hear the winds upbraid
And nought but heaven can tell me then
Mourn, sooty coots, and speckled teals;
That I should never hear Apollo's song,
The poets in the tales they tell
With a sedate and all-enduring eye;--
They only wonder "some folks" do not starve.
where the dew lies on the primrose, the violet and whitethorn leaves
Deep in the unpruned forest, 'midst the roar
And pride, and power, and king, and clown
Nor yet forget how Venice once was dear,
And the cowslip was nodding its head.
Poured forth his unpremeditated lay,
She took the rock, and wi' a knock
A lion into growling, loth retire--
To shun a tyrant father's hate,
Thy wee bit housie, too, in ruin;
Of life have I preserv'd thee to this day,
In mighty graduations, part by part,
O thou pale orb, that silent shines,
The nights are lang in winter, Sir;
And thou art distant in Humanity.
With many a scalding tear and many a groan,
Such is the refuge of our youth and age--
Yet there is one who never feels a fear
And the last song I ever wrote is thine.
She seemed to hear my silent voice
With some deep and immedicable wound;--
Some rhyme a neighbour's name to lash;
And Crossberry Way and old Round Oak's narrow lane
But death's unwelcome, honest odds
But of _meet_ or _unmeet_ in a _fabric complete_,
Dear as the raptur'd thrill of joy!
Traced every wood and shattered clothes again,
Peep'd o'er the mountains high;
But times will change and friends must part
And fain would he have loosed the key
He feign'd to snirtle in his sleeve,
Such as Harmodius  drew on Athens' tyrant Lord.
Upon a calm sea drifting: and meanwhile
Against his pallid face: he felt the charm
O pardon me, for I am full of grief--
And underneath the spreading tree
Rose, one by one, till all outspreaded were;
As if they did rejoice o'er a young Earthquake's birth.
'Twas night, calm night, the moon was high;
Abusin' me for harsh ill nature
There is not a woodland nigh nor is there a green grove,
Wilt fall asleep? O let me sip that tear!
Encircled in her clasping arms,
Endymion heard not: down his steed him bore,
Left his young cheek; and how he used to stray
Dark regions are around it, where the tombs
So, ye may doucely fill a throne,
And diamonded with panes of quaint device,
To and fro they are hurried about;
Felt faint, and would have sunk among the rest,
Childe Harold hailed Leucadia's cape afar;
As that thou speakest of? Are not these green nooks
Dear brother robin this comes from us all
And the morning awoke, saw a sight rather odd--
Not far hence Atlas; and beside him prone
Maids shout to breakfast in a merry strife,
Thy vales of evergreen, thy hills of snow,
Stern Mentor urged from high to yonder tide;
A chain-droop'd lamp was flickering by each door;
His English style, an' gestures fine,
When youthfu' lovers first were pair'd,
Or else he would muster the heads of the clan,
My strange love came--Felicity's abyss!
Fair Burnet strikes th' adoring eye,
But downa do's come o'er me now,
Sorrow more beautiful than Beauty's self.
We never more shall hear,--but never more,
Till, growing with its growth, we thus dilate
He healed the sick and sent abroad
From the imprinted couch, and when he did,
A sense of real things comes doubly strong,
And balm, and mint, with curled-leaf parsley grew,
Or haply, prest with cares and woes,
Deil mak his kings-hood in a spleuchan!
In storms an' tempests raise you up,
The test of Truth, Love--sole philosopher,
For offal kernels that the poultry leaves,
While back-recoiling seem'd to reel
Here was commons for their hills, where they seek for freedom still,
He still was a stranger to fear;
Light feet, dark violet eyes, and parted hair;
Their hearts and swords are metal true--
Thou need na jouk behint the hallan,
A coof cam in wi' routh o' gear,
Whose bubbling did a genial freshness fling,
O happiness, how simple is thy track.
And 'mong the cliffs disclos'd a stately form,
I think I maun wed him to-morrow, to-morrow,
To what my own full thoughts had made too tender,
A clammy dew is beading on my brow,
And strove who should be smother'd deepest in
In sad demeanour, solemn, undisturb'd,
And if it came at last, hark, and rejoice!
Whether the summer kindly warms,
I'll warrant then, ye're nae deceiver,
Where stones will turn to flooding streams,
He weeping wail'd his latter times;
To be a jarring and a dissonant thing,
I'll sing the zeal Drumlanrig bears,
Thou's ay the dearer and dearer to me!
But hear, my lord! Glengarry, hear!
An' then cry zeal for gospel laws,
There's no one that could ever tell;
Lies down and licks his feet and turns away.
Until we taste the life of love again.
Of playfellows, the laughing Summer brings,
To make him Nature's playmate. He knows well
Ye flowery banks o' bonnie Doon,
Derives from thee a sense so deep and clear
O, whar did ye get that hauver meal bannock?
Grated the quaystones with her brazen prow
My head, and kiss death's foot. Love! love, farewel!
Some enemy: far forth his bow is bent
Though now 'tis tatter'd; leaving my bark bar'd
And the old tinker's budget lay still in the weather,
My curse upon thy venom'd stang,
The poor man weeps--here Gavin sleeps,
She doth not tack from side to side--
The magic wand then let us wield;
And soothed them into slumbers full and deep.
Golden, or rainbow-sided, or purplish,
Them right and tight in thack an' rape.
Dovelike in the dim cell lying beyond
Detraction's eye no aim can gain,
What sparkling jewels glance, man!
Windows and doors, in nameless sculpture drest,
Slopings of verdure through the glossy tide,
But in his mother's haughty look
Childe Harold saw them in their Chieftain's tower
And Harry's flesh it fell away;
In mony a torrent down the snaw-broo rowes;
Oer wrecks where crowds of fames are gone.
And when it shall revive, as is our trust,
That sark she coft for her wee Nannie,
Where are the charms and virtues which we dare
These, their richly gleaming waves,
She dabbles, on the cool and sluicy sands:
For none can pass him but his witless grace
But Queen Netherplace, of a diff'rent complexion,
The riddle nature could not prove
The Death-fires danc'd at night;
Or naething else to trouble thee;
On the half rotten ashtree's topmost twig,
Grey waving to the sunny gleam,
All suffering doth destroy, or is destroyed,
Let Bourbon exult in his gay gilded Lilies,
Then homeward all take off their sev'ral way;
Saws of experience, sage and sound.
Our sex with guile and faithless love
To some high noble and his olive-trees.
Savory, latter-mint, and columbines,
Dashing or winding as its torrent strays;
Though little given to care and thought,
Wha waste your weel-hain'd gear on d--d new Brigs and Harbours!
I lock'd her in my fond embrace!
Fair is proud Seville; let her country boast
And ploughman's callings that more hoarse proceed
And grow upon the spot--all-seeing but unseen.
For the unhappy youth--Love! I have felt
Were foil'd, who watch'd to trace them to their house:
Let Fortune's gifts at random flee,
Keeps off the bothering bustle of the wind,
"Who from a sea-fight has been brought to Falmouth,
Was modern Luxury of Commerce born,
With silvery oak apples, and fir cones brown--
Rising like water-columns from the sea--
But, Och! I backward cast my e'e,
He had touch'd his forehead, he began to thread
He hirpl'd up and lap like daft,
I watch'd the symptoms o' the great,
And now, perhaps, he's hunting sheep,
And win perhaps that night a peerless bride,
Nought can resist his mighty strength;
Are not our lowing heifers sleeker than
A man may drink and no be drunk;
Like the bright spots that move about the sun;
Just where her falling hair might be outspread
Then when I'm tir'd--and sae are ye,
For heaven is parted from thee, and the earth
Of mine was once made perfect in these woods.
The tomb, the earth, the flowers, and dew.
It comes upon us like the glorious pealing
Fall on my head, and presently unmew
Of tangled wonder, breathless and aghast.
A populous solitude of bees and birds,
And mix'd her wailings with the raving storm.
With cruel pierce, and bringing him again
The two deliverers tasted a pure wine
In chaffing restlessness, is yet more drear
And giants alone can his spirits capsize.
Or loup the ecliptic like a bar;
A voice is speaking; hark, it louder calls.
"And then a' doctor's saws and whittles,
This all? Yet it is strange, and sad, alas!
Some necessary cause must surely be;
Darken above our bones, yet fondly deemed
And ca'd the girrs out owre us a'--
Appalled, an owlet's 'larum chilled with dread,
Or dark Sierras rise in craggy pride?
Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain--
Where the thick hedge the warmest house supplies,
Light, as reflected from a silver flame:
To see the old tinker's toil make such a gap
The widow's tears, the orphan's cry?
More beautiful than our fantastic sky,
Whiles holding fast his guid blue bonnet;
Like drumlie winter, dark and drear,
I walked forth to view the corn,
Through buried paths, where sleepy twilight dreams
But, as for his fine nabob fortune,
Of stedfast genius, toiling gallantly!
A towmond o' trouble, should that be my fa',
Of what in me is sleepless,--if I rest.
And on those pinions, level in mid air,
Come, will ye court a noble lord,
And drink them to hell, Sir! or ne'er see me more!"
Could shake them o'er the burning dub,
But better stuff ne'er claw'd a midden--
Still downward with capacious whirl they glide,
Of thine enmossed realms: O thou, to whom
She wept;--because she had no more to say
Into the sparry hollows of the world!
Things that in childhood's memory dwell--
Full joy I feel, while thus I cleave the air,
The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves.
But let me see thee stoop from heaven on wings
Of all her sapphires, greens, and amethyst,
First in to touch the orchard wall or tree,
But not a love like mine, my Katy!
Oh! she is fairest in her features wild,
Our minds and hearts to bless--
But the cheerful spring came kindly on,
I'll wander on, with tentless heed
And scarcely for one moment could be caught
But where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest.
A sorry, poor misbegot son of the muses,
A little onward ran the very stream
O spectres busy in a cold, cold gloom!
In vain with Squire Billy, for laurels you struggle,
With careful step to keep his balance up
Reels with its fulness; there--for ever there--
Wad make a wretch forget his woe;
Sudden he stops--his eye is fixed--away--
"Young lover, I must weep--such hellish spite
Fill'd with pervading brilliance and perfume:
His heart beat awfully against his side;
The horsemen back to Forth, man;
Too huge for mortal tongue or pen of scribe:
Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find
Would show the tragic muse in a' her glory.
For solitary thinkings; such as dodge
I am too flinty-hard for thy nice touch:
A' that I bargain'd for, an' mair;
To those who gaze on thee what language could they speak?
The self-same moment I could pray;
Since life's gay scenes must charm no more,
Neath the wild shelter of a knotty oak,
The fever of vain longing, and the name
Wha first shall rise to gang awa',
Earth with her haughty shadow, and displayed,
Wad mak a saint forget the sky.
To take the terror of his fears to town,--
Nor raise my voice, nor vainly dare to soar,
Round many western islands have I been
For I would watch all night to see unfold
One sigh of real breath--one gentle squeeze,
But boils up in a spring-tide flood!
O, gie me the lass wi' the weel-stockit farms.
Nestling a rose, convuls'd as though it smarted
Thou glorious mirror, where the Almighty's form
Feathered with love and nature's good intents?
Or gied her faes a claw, Jamie:
They took nae pains their speech to balance,
They hecht him some fine braw ane;
And for a mantle large and broad,
And aye I muse and sing thy name--
Held as a courser in the rider's hand.
We came na here to view your warks
How, ever, where she will'd, her spirit went;
"See, here's a scythe, and there's a dart,
Such sweetness would relent her,
Thy witching smiles wean them of half their cares;
Where'er we gaze--around--above--below,--
'Gainst whom he raged with fury strange and blind.
Wi' stocks out-owre their shouther;
In bloodier acts conclude those who with blood began.
The forward clown has many things to say
The Boat came close beneath the Ship,
He has a fouth o' auld nick-nackets:
His mansion and his sepulchre--both plain
Or, Moses bade eternal warfare wage
Is a full harvest whence to reap high feeling;
Too high for Night to come at--mountains shine,
Whilst I--but I shall haud me there--
Playful still his hours to keep,
Long have I said, how happy he who shrives
Her point would always on the blank alight;
Yield from thy sanctuary some clear air,
Why, you might read two sonnets, ere they reach
Who can contemplate Fame through clouds unfold
Then han' in nieve some day we'll knot it,
By the same fire to boil their pottage,
Thus to the elements he poured his last "Good Night."
The wife of my bosom, alas! she did die;
She's sweet as the ev'ning amang the new hay;
--But some night-wandering Man, whose heart was pierc'd
There came a dream, shewing how a young man,
While the tear stood twinklin' in her e'e;
My heart is sair--I dare na tell--
So sweetly to these ravish'd ears of mine
Bidding the last day's troubles all goodbye;
To cheer itself to Delphi. Still his feet
And swarthy Nubia's mutilated son;
All creatures joy in the sun's returning,
Might fancy-fit his brows, silk-pillow'd at his ease.
Can act, is acting there against man's life:
Enchantress! tell me by this soft embrace,
His twisted head look'd backward on the way,
For, faith, they'll aiblins fin' them fashious;
An' cheek-for-chow, a chuffie vintner,
But ye whom social pleasure charms,
Are at it, skelpin' jig and reel,
As careless as if nothing were,
Ye Irish lords, ye knights an' squires,
So, gratefu', back your news I send you,
And sometimes, too, wi' warldly trust,
"My Madeline! sweet dreamer! lovely bride!
Here, where the Roman million's blame or praise
The shaft hath just been shot--the arrow bright
Herself grow Eden once again, possest of Love and thee.
This ditty to her!--tell her"--so I stay'd
Now, thank our stars! these Gothic times are fled;
"As sure as there's a moon in heaven,"
But sip, and twitter, and their feathers sleek;
Though an immortal, she felt cruel pain:
The shades of wonted night were gathering yet,
Through shadows of the crimping brake.
Though cruel fate should bid us part,
If she had heart to knock again;
Ye birdies dumb, in withering bowers,
Sweet Hope, celestial influence round me shed,
My drink was the fountain, my church the tall trees.
They who but feign a wounded heart
Far under-ground, a sleeper meets his friends
Wi' a' his brimstane squadrons,
Young Robie was the brawest lad,
And Betty's husband's at the wood,
Within the bush, her covert nest
The wild brood saw me weep, my fate enquired,
For that fair maiden's tender feet.
Great God of breathless cups and chirping mirth!--
Listen, Stranger! Mist and Snow,
A seat I'm sure ye're weel deservin't;
Which blighted their life's bloom, and then departed:--
Peona, ye should hand in hand repair
With her two brothers this fair lady dwelt,
Beauties that ev'n a cynic must avow;
Who found a more than common Votary there
_He must pursue this task of joy and grief
And stands above and sees the eggs below;
O plight me your faith, my Mary,
For ne'er a bosom yet was prief
To the sun-brown'd Arab's lip;--
Or new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow.
Like to a diver in the pearly seas,
When her war-song was heard on Andalusia's shore?
And there blaws up a hearty crack;
Even while they brought the burden to a close,
As ill I like my fauts to tell;
Long patience has such mild composure given,
With many a most diverting thing,
Whene'er the fate of those I hold most dear
Yet they could violate each saddening shrine,
When, like a cloud, he sits upon the air,
Gives hope to the valiant, and promise of war;
Have one, said the tinker; but wit was away,
She eyes her freeborn, martial boys,
Ay, it shall rise, and shine, and be
Before whose heavenly hues all Sorrow disappears.
For far in the west lives he I Io'e best,
Writhe at defeat, and nurse your agonies!
Come back before me, as his skill beguiles
To sudden veneration: women meek
And come, my faithful sodger lad,
If such be of my creed the plan,
And from his further bank Ætolia's wolds espied.
The part of Philip's son was thine, not then
O wha will to Saint Stephen's house,
O, gie me the lass that has acres o' charms,
Industry's bustling din once more devours
And the bare heath of life presents no bloom;
Sips nectar in the opening flower,
Who let me taste that more than cordial dram,
But it's not her air, her form, her face,
Until the ploughman changed it to the song.
Beneath thy drowsy wing a triple hour,
Are doom'd by man, that tyrant o'er the weak,
My greatest grief is that I leave
From fright of dim espial. Safe at last,
But never may be garner'd. I must stoop
Trees with aged arms were warring.
And long to change the robe of revel for the shroud!
Fain would he have commanded, fain took throne
There saw she direst strife; the supreme God
Mark me, Peona! that sometimes it brought
And Maxwell true o' sterling blue:
And struts and sprunts his tail and then lets drag
Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd,
That's trusted faithless man, jo.
Tortures hot breath, and speech of agony,
Thou minds me o' the happy days
What hopes it sends to Betty's heart!
That to our folly or our guilt we owe.
The ever-smitten Hermes empty left
So Hermes thought, and a celestial heat
Our force united on thy foes we'll turn,
Like puzzled urchin on an aged crone
And at night, in barn or stable,
Rain as it may, will keep us dryly here:
A nation swoln with ignorance and pride,
Or strutted in a bank an' clarkit
To mark while, leaping oer the dripping path,
That aft has borne me hame frae Killie,
Hurl down with crashing rattle:
And I will wear them for his sake,
Aye, millions sparkled on a vein of gold,
Home to its cloud this lightning of the mind,
At last my feet a resting-place had found:
leaves, primroses, violets, vernal speedwell, bluebell and orchis, and
My muse dow scarcely spread her wing!
By him to whom the energy was given
Town's bodies ran, an' stood abeigh,
Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.
Come forth into the light of things,
What ties cruel Fate in my bosom has torn!
Scampers circuitous, with startled ears
Now, when the wine has done its rosy deed,
Could not her quarries furnish forth one bust?
When the light shines serene but doth not glare--
With steady aim some Fortune chase;
A farmer's shepherd, oer his glass,
Green, slender, leaf-clad holly-boughs
An' there will be Logan Mac Douall,
Sheep ointment seems to daub the dead-hued sky,
Of his swift magic. Diving swans appear
Thus bending o'er the vessel's laving side,
That same Adonis, safe in the privacy
Of words, like sunbeams, dazzling as they past
While down the wretched vital part is driv'n!
Ye Powers of peace, and peaceful song,
What bloody wars, if Spirites had blood to shed,
Of the late darken'd time,--the murderous spite
And Thou, who never yet of human wrong
The feeling heart's the royal blue,
And dries the morning's chilly robes of dew,
He hastens down and fears his master come,
By thee were fashion'd to the self-same end;
A presence that disturbs me with the joy
"Does she repeat that doleful cry?"
Doom'd with enfeebled carcase to outstretch
No tongue shall ask, whence come ye? but ye shall
Or why has man the will and power
Our first and sweetest nurture--when the wife,
Entice him once to listen to their songs;
My tocher's the bargain ye wad buy;
While the great waters are at ebb and flow.--
Loftiest on loftiest and least sheltered rocks,
That e'er attempted stealth or rief,
To thee, lov'd Nith, thy gladsome plains,
Till it has panted round, and stolen a share
Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards,
The butcher deeds of bloody fate
The blackbird strong, the lintwhite clear,
Folding his robe in dying dignity--
At which soft ravishment, with doating cry
I speak not of men's creeds--they rest between
That sunny walls from Boreas screen--
From out its crystal dwelling in a lake,
And e'en when this beauty your bosom has blest,
He fans the feathers of her breast--
A skyey mask, a pinion'd multitude,--
In thy childhood where flourished the city of God.
About the halls, and to and from the doors,
Might furnish forth creation:--Italy!
Ye maggots, feast on Nicol's brain,
What time the moon, wi' silent glow'r,
Underneath large blue-bells tented,
Thou, my friend, canst truly tell:
But, chiefly, in their hearts with grace divine preside.
And wonders; struggles to devise some blame;
But oh! what will my torments be,
Wherewith disturb'd, she utter'd a soft moan:
Good Angela, believe me by these tears;
I start in Hamlet, in Othello roar;
Yet, in our very souls, we feel amain
Could not thy harshest vengeance be content,
As soon's the clockin-time is by,
In five months' time, should he be seen,
Of diverse moths, that aye their rest are quitting;
The dingy denizens are reared in dirt;
With the noise of fountains wond'rous,
And vermin'd gipsies litter'd heretofore.
Loves, Graces, and Virtues, I call not on you;
The hillocks, dropt in Nature's careless haste;
And thus; while Hermes on his pinions lay,
The rich blue green of summer all the year,
An' she has twa, sparkling roguish een.
Have a big-bellied bottle when harass'd with care!
The courtier tells a finer tale--
Immortal bliss for me too hast thou won._
I thought them all eternal when by Langley Bush I lay,
He look'd and look'd again a level--No!
A jillet brak his heart at last,
Or hath that antique mien and robed form
'Mang moors an' mosses many, O,
Who, all beneath his high command,
Of Ocean, or the stars, mingle--and not in vain.
With many joys for him: the warder's ken
May delude the thoughtless pair:
Call ardently! He was indeed wayworn;
The fear o' Hell's a hangman's whip,
And much oppress'd and bruis'd she was;
My soul with under darkness; to entice
There, groaning, dying, she did lie,
When not a star bestowed its light,
And now he's forced to work, though weak,
I once was persuaded a venture to make;
Whose distant roaring swells and fa's.
A chieftain king's: beneath his breast, half bare,
Their clenched teeth still clench'd, and all their limbs
From morn till night, from night till startled Morn
Then I maun sit the lee lang day,
Long didst thou sit amid our regions wild
The papers are barren of home-news or foreign,
And Love, which lent a blazon to their shields,
And hastes to sheltering bowers.
Stood, wan, and pale, and with an awed face,
His love grew desperate; and defying death,
_There_ was their Dacian mother--he, their sire,
Wad better fill'd their station
The close of Troilus and Cressid sweet.
An' there will be stamp-office Johnnie,
Their ample feathers, are in slumber dead,--
Whose silent wheels, fresh wet from clouds of morn,
I love the weeds along the fen,
The birds sit chittering in the thorn,
A motion and a spirit, that impels
Pure pleasure while he can; the scorching ray
And many dream withal the hour is nigh
Arose, with locks not oozy, and began,
Of my delighted fancy,--I could brood
But now your brow is beld, John,
While caps and bonnets aff are taen,
Has wrought a silence, from the stove there shrills
O Thames! that other bards may see,
No where at all, save heaven, and the grave.
Meanwhile in other realms big tears were shed,
New Brig was buskit in a braw new coat,
And not a wind of heaven but will breathe
I see the lark down-dropping to his nest.
And bless auld Coila, large and long,
I'll be his debt twa mashlum bonnocks,
Morat and Marathon twin names shall stand;
While day blinks in the lift sae hie;
Five years of happiness or more,
A hogshead of stingo just rolled from a dray,
In ponderous stone, developing the mood
Or more complete to overwhelm surmise?
As bees gorge full their cells. And, by the feud
O sweetest essence! sweetest of all minions!
Or I shall drowse beside thee, so my soul doth ache."
I thought upon the witching smile
Of Jove's large eye-brow, to the tender greening
Lest he owre high and proud should turn,
They gie the wit of age to youth;
Of every guest; that each, as he did please,
Of both the guarded nymph near-smiling on the green.
As on a place of agony and strife,
And doubts hung there it was not mine to seek;
Chloris, Chloris all the theme,
But I gae mad at their grimaces,
Wha will they station at the cock?
These will in throngs before my mind intrude:
And gae his bridle-reins a shake,
And eagles struggle with the buffeting north
To melting pulp, that fish would have bright mail,
Would from such letters in his mind appear.
Her eye intent on all the mazy plan,
They could not surely give belief, that such
The western breeze steals thro' the trees,
Tell them wha hae the chief direction,
Whose holy dust was scattered long ago;
By loss o' blood or want of breath,
Among the river sallows, borne aloft
There's ne'er a flower that blooms in May,
But for to meet the deil her lane,
To cease upon the midnight with no pain,
Or trace hay-scented meadows, smooth and long,
"The devil take his wisdom!" said
A very brother's yearning for thee steal
But those scarfs of blood-red shall be redder, before
The star that rules my luckless lot,
He never heeds the insult loud that laughs:
Dread not their taunts, my little life!
The polyanthus peeps with blebs of dew,
And still will dance with ever varied case,
Till the diamond's ace, of Indian race,
Or wert,--a young Aurora of the air,
But his was not the love of living dame,
Then we'll be damn'd, no doubt, Dumourier.
Hanging with threat'ning jut like precipices;
Who, capable of no articulate sound,
By this the sun is setting; we may chance
White-plum'd lilies, and the first
His messenger, his little Mercury,
Twas nature's beauty that inspired
A man may fight and no be slain;
Were ae day nibbling on the tether,
Into these regions came I following him,
The Cameleon-savage disturbed her repose,
Through a long pillar'd vista, a fair shrine,
Deeming it midnight:--Temples--Baths--or Halls?
And in the dawn she started up awake;
Because thy guilt's supreme enough for all?
In reverence veiled--my crystalline dominion
'Tis fair enough for thee, my dove!
Shall be Death's slaves at last.
An' hardly, in a winter's season,
Each idle--and all ill--and none the worst--
Methought I should be wiser next,
Came waggish fauns, and nymphs, and satyrs stark,
Fresh legions pour adown the Pyrenees:
Is source of wayward thought and stern disdain:
But what his common sense came short
And rising, weets wi' misty showers
While thick an' thrang, an' loud an' lang,
Wi' people that ken ye nae better,
Without this life or home or name,
Had pour'd a mortal oil upon his head,
His heart by causeless wanton malice wrung,
For what became of this poor child
And why? it is not lessened--but thy mind,
But in the teeth o' baith to sail,
Her teeth are like the nightly snow
How her short absence might be unsurmised,
But Rab slips out, an' jinks about,
Vain are the pleasaunces on earth supplied;
From dog-rose, woodbine, clover, all
More beautiful than ever twisted braid,
Ye'll keep me waukin wi' your din;
As theirs alone, the patent-bliss
And now he turns a jutting point of land,
Three hosts combine to offer sacrifice;
As now 'tis done to thee, Endymion. Hence
Sore given to revel and ungodly glee;
"He's not so wise as some folks be,"
Nor here War's clarion, but Love's rebeck  sounds;
Though from our birth the Faculty divine
And when thou first didst in that mirror trace
The schoolboy hears and wonder fills his breast.
The day returns, my bosom burns,
Like fortune's favours, tint as win.
From the fast mouldering head there shut from view:
Much specious lore, but little understood;
His face unto his horse's tail,
That would be lear eneugh for me,
[Yields] scant grass pining after showers,
Then come, sweet Muse, inspire my lay!
The joys refin'd of sense and taste,
Wha for thy sake wad gladly die?
Hog-shouther, jundie, stretch an' strive,
But up arose the martial Chuck,
But he whose blossom buds in guilt
I wander'd in a forest thoughtlessly,
And annual marriage now no more renewed--
In Venice Tasso's echoes are no more,
But then the beauteous hill of moss
Sceptre, and mantle, clasp'd with dewy gem,
Those same dark curls blown vagrant in the wind;
But, G-d-sake! let nae saving-fit
Fell sick within the rose's just domain,
'Till lairds forbade, by strict commands,
The waves in easy motion went rolling on their way,
And sun oursells about the dyke,
The fate of empires and the fall of kings;
Over the proud Place where an Emperor sued,
Firm may she rise with generous disdain
Gude night, and joy be wi' thee;
The thummart, wil'-cat, brock, and tod,
Cried, "Lycius! gentle Lycius!"--Borne aloft
And garlanding grew wild; and pleasure reign'd.
Schooling its half-fledg'd little ones to brush
Thou even brightens dark Despair
A vera gude tocher, a cotter-man's dochter,
Can give a bliss o'ermatching thine,
Thou who beheldest, 'mid the assassins' din,
And by the moonlight, Betty Foy
Their thoughts I cannot measure,
"And thou art long and lank and brown
And thieves of every rank and station,
Till the miller, expecting that all would get loose,
Far, far around shall those dark-cluster'd trees
A mutual language, clearer than the tome
That happy night was worth them a',
His quiver is mysterious, none can know
And graceful in his rustic dress!
Down to a block--immortal rebel! See
Haunted me like a passion: the tall rock,
That ne'er did wrong to thine or thee.
Feeding at will along the lane,
Or some hotch-potch that's rightly neither,
Lord! a louse, Sir, is still but a louse,
Feed upon apples red, and strawberries,
For preaching that three's are an' twa.
Each eye it cheers, when she appears,
The fervid choir that lifted up a noise
Fondled the maidens with the breasts of cream;
An' teach the lanely heights an' howes
Then crows, and looks about for little crumbs,
Sweet Arethusa! Dian's self must feel
She kist the sea-nymph's cheek,--who sat her down
Trode i' the mire out o' sight!
Down in the blue-bells, or a wren light rustling
And will you leave me on the hills alone?
Had the sword laid thee with the mighty low,
Thus whisper'd low and solemn in his ear.
All day she spun in her poor dwelling,
Is this thy faithful swain's reward--
And catch the cheated eye in wild surprise,
So I sent sighs behind her and walked to my cell.
Too swept off senates while he hewed the throne
Like rock or stone, it is o'ergrown
"To give my counsels all in one,
Nursing her wrath to keep it warm.
That long has stood the wind and rain;
I tell nae common tale o' grief--
Flowers weep in dew-drops oer them, and the gale gently sighs
Nothing to loathe in Nature, save to be
Instead of sweets, his ample palate took
The wild rocks shaped, as they had turrets been,
Nor anxious fear, nor cankert care,
Ae market-day thou wasna sober;
And rested at the foot of those wild hills,
And think me how some barter joy for care,
And all the revels he had lorded there:
Offensive to the heavenly powers? Caught
Even with mealy gold the waters clear.
Like one who on the earth had never slept.
He bids to sober joy that here sojourns:
What is right and what is wrang?
Whare three lairds' lands met at a burn,
The hawthorn trees blow in the dew of the morning,
Let the blast sweep o'er the valley,
Bending their graceful figures till they meet
For by some freakful chance he made retire
That crown my harvest cares wi' joy,
Protract a curst existence, with the brood
Of hoarded vengeance till thine Eagles flew
That shoots my tortur'd gums alang;
When once set down she never goes away,
Fretting the fever round the languid heart,
With Betty all was not so well,
Save one, who look'd thereon with eye severe,
Art thou, too, near such doom? vague fear there is:
My heart's in the Highlands a-chasing the deer;
Each mortar-bearing bird awaits:
And never learnt a prayer, nor told a bead,
And whose more rife with merriment than thine,
Yes, there must be a golden victory;
A d--n'd red wud Kilburnie blastie!
